# Wordle Local Web Game

This is a **Wordle** clone I created as a fun little project during my free time. It's a simple web-based game where the player has to guess the hidden word, much like the popular game **Wordle**. The game is entirely front-end, meaning it runs in the browser without any backend server.

## Features:
- Simple and interactive UI.
- User can input letters into a grid.
- Feedback is given for each guess:
  - **Green** for correct letters in the correct position.
  - **Yellow** for correct letters in the wrong position.
  - **Grey** for incorrect letters.
- The game supports multiple rows for multiple guesses.
- Game ends when the user guesses the word correctly or after the maximum number of attempts.

## What I did:
I built this project as a personal learning exercise and a fun way to practice JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and event handling. It includes:
- Dynamic handling of user input.
- Event listeners for keyboard interactions.
- Basic styling with HTML and CSS.
- Simple logic to compare the guessed word with a target word and provide feedback.
  
## Current Status:
- **Fully functional**: The game works well for its intended purpose and provides a fun experience.
- **Responsive design**: Works well on most screen sizes.

## Potential Fixes & Updates:
Here are some potential improvements and ideas for future updates:

1. **Word List Improvement**:
   - The current list of words is hardcoded. In the future, it can be replaced with an external API that provides random words, or a larger word list can be used for more variety.

2. **Add Difficulty Levels**:
   - Allow users to choose the length of the word or the number of attempts before starting the game.

3. **User Authentication (optional)**:
   - Implement a simple login system to track high scores or even offer a leaderboard.

4. **Responsive Mobile Version**:
   - Improve the mobile responsiveness for smaller devices. While it's usable, additional tweaks to the grid layout on small screens could improve the user experience
